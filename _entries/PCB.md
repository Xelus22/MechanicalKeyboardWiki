Many of the main sites such as taobao, aliexpress and other smaller mechanical keyboard shops stock PCB's. There are countless groupbuys and sales on r/mechmarket and sometimes advertised on r/mechanicalkeyboards (e.g. massdrop). 

However if you would like a to custom design your own PCB, check out <a href = 'https://github.com/ruiqimao/keyboard-pcb-guide'><strong>this</strong></a> link by Ruiqi Mao. It is a full guide using KiCad, with a step by step intstruction. 

If there are any further questions, there are lots of people in the Mechanical Keyboards Discord server where these experts are willing to help.
