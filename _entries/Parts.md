- There are many different parts to a keyboard. Here is a typical list of what items you will need to make a keyboard by yourself:    

<strong>Note:</strong> * means optional
<ul>
<li><strong>Switches</strong> (<a href = "#Switches">above</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Case</strong></li>
<li><strong>Plate</strong>* (use a plate if going for a plate-mounted build or handwire)</li>
<li><strong>PCB</strong>* (if not PCB then handwire)</li>
<li><strong>Stabilizers</strong>* (use stabilizers only if there are keys longer than or equal to 2u)</li>
<li><strong>Keycaps</strong></li>
<li><strong>Firmware</strong></li>
</ul>

You will also need to consider the layout that is best suited for you as there are many layouts to choose from. From the smallest, 30% keyboards all the way to fullsize keyboards.

If you are going to handwire the keyboard, you <strong><u>must</u></strong> have a plate and plate-mounted stabilizers and separate micro-controller. We will be going into handwired builds later in the wiki.
