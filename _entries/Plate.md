- There are many places where you can buy common plates for your keyboard. 60% plates are the most common among all the form factors making it extremely easily to build a 60% keyboard. You can buy them on r/mechmarket, aliexpress, banggood, taobao, ebay, massdrop (sometimes), and even some of the smaller shops.

If you are making own custom keyboard, making plate is essential if you wish to handwire the project. Use <a href="http://keyboard-layout-editor.com">http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/</a>, and then use <a href="http://builder.swillkb.com">http://builder.swillkb.com/</a> to make this plate as a vector file. Then you can cut that out of your desired material. For metal plates, you can use BigBlueSaw or Lasergist, or your local cutter which should be cheaper than the aforementioned options.
