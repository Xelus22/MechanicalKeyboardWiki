There are countless designs and colourways in which everyday new ideas are shown on forums such as Reddit and GeekHack. 
Subjectively, the keycap profile is more important than just colourways as they change the feel of the keyboard itself. Each profile is unique and can affect the feel and quality of the keyboard. You can find exisiting keycap sets at <a href = 'www.keypuller.com'>KeyPuller</a>.

The picture below shows different profiles in keycaps. However there are new types being produced and not in the list such as the new TaiHao profile.
