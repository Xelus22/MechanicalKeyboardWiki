- There are many layouts to choose from as you may know from /r/MechanicalKeyboards, GeekHack, Deskthority and many other forums/websites. It may be overwhelming to some choosing the right layout but there's always a starting. Here is a guide by LivingSpeedBump, the celebrity over at <a href = 'http://keychatter.com'>keychatter.com</a> which covers most of the common layouts. 

<a href = 'https://www.massdrop.com/talk/947/keyboard-layouts-explained-in-detail-many-pics?mode=group_open'>Here</a> is a link to the original post.

I thought it would be exceptionally helpful to have a post discussing keyboard layouts, showing what "standard physical layouts" are, and showing what keys differ for many popular alternative layout keyboards. I am not pointing out correct legend placement with these pictures, with programmable boards that would just be a nightmare, and is more of a discussion just for designers.
Here is the standard keyboard layout (ANSI and ISO). I have color coded the graphic in this way:

    60% - Light Blue
    TKL/80% - Green
    TK/Fullsize/100% - Yellow
    ISO - Dark Blue (Keys that differ from standard ANSI)

So, with this system any keyboard that is covered by light blue/green/yellow caps alone <strong>SHOULD</strong> be covered by a standard 104 keycap set (like Ducky, Tai Hao, etc). Keep in mind a few more boards can be covered by these sets, just not with the correct profile for each key. 

At the end of this article will be a Download section where I will link all of the Raw data so you can import any of these layouts into Keyboard-Layout-Editor.com for further inquisition of any layout. You will be able to see the exact keys sizes through doing this as well.
