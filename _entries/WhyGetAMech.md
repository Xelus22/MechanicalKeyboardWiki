---
There are many reasons as to why a user would want a mechanical keyboard:
 <ol type="1">
  <li><strong>Durability</strong></li>
  
Not only do mechanical switches such as Gateron or Cherry (which we will go more indepth on later) have an extremely long life span of up to 50million actuations.
  
  <li><strong>Customizability</strong></li>
  
  Customizability is another main reason as to why the mechanical keyboards community are very dedicated to the hobby. Such as custom layouts (e.g. minivan - 40%, VE.A - split 65%, etc.) and colours, building custom cases for the keyboard and these are just a few examples.
  
  <li><strong>Feel</strong></li>
  
  Each and every keyboard feels unique depending on the materials used to make the keyboard and the switch type. These can be all personalised to your taste and liking. 

  <li><strong>Community</strong></li>
  
  Mechanical keyboards hobby has developed into a very large community where people in the community even start making custom keycaps and artisans for the community.
