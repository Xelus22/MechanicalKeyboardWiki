Stabilisers are used to stabilise large keys which are larger than 2u. Where 1u is the size of a standard key (e.g. The alphabet keys).

There are 2 main types of stabiliser for MX compatible switches.

The first is Cherry style stabilisers where they can clip into either the plate or the PCB. They are also easier to change keycaps with, however have their problems as many clones appear on the market. Genuine Cherry style stabilisers are expensive compared to clones. 

The other is Costar style stabilisers. These only mount to the plate and are slightly harder and more annoying to remove switches from.
