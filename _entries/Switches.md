- First of all, there is no <strong>best</strong> switch. There is a misconception that mx blues were the best for typing, reds/browns for gaming. However, this is not true. Each person will have their own personal preference based on the type of switch.

There are many different switch manufacturers such as Gateron, Kailh, Greetech, Cherry (now known as ZF) and many others. Each company has their own way of colour-coding the switches into their different properties and aspects. 

Below is a table of all the switches known to the community. Each entry shows the type of switch, the actuation and bottom out force and includes a picture for easy identification. You may add new switches yourself as new switches appear from the community or OEMs.
