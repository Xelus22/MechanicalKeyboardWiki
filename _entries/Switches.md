- First of all, <strong>there is no best switch.</strong> There is a misconception that Cherry MX Blues are the best for typing and Cherry MX Reds or Browns for gaming. However, this is not true. Each person will have their own personal preference based on the type of switch.

There are many different types of switches in keyboards. All of them have their unique feel along with its pros and cons.

    <td width = '60%' align = 'left'>By far the most common type of standalone keyboard it is cheap and easy to find. Unfortunately has a lower lifetime and many people think they feel like mashed potatoes after using a Mechanical Keyboard. See /r/Keyboard for more info.</td>

    <td width = '60%' align = 'left'>Originally designed for laptops these have a short travel from 1mm in the Surface Pro 3 to 3.2mm in some Logitech Keyboards. An advantage is there are many Tenkeyless and Full Size standalone keyboards in wireless and backlit configurations. For more info see /r/keyboard</td>

    <td width = '10%'>Buckling Spring</td>
    <td width = '60%' align = 'left'>Relatively high activation force (~75g). Nice <i>Click</i> upon activation, and <i>Clack</i> upon deactivation. A good metaphor is like wearing fat boots on a wood floor. Like a cowboy. Clunky and crisp, in a good way. A user once said that every key on a buckling spring feels like the launch button on a space ship!</td>

    <td width = '10%'>Topre</td>
    <td width = '60%' align = 'left'>Some say this is the most elegant feels. It's said to feel smoother than Cherry, but far more solid than a standard rubber dome. They're soft when bottomed out, and are not clicky. They're only featured on a few, expensive keyboards. They use a combination of a rubber dome and a spring for their mechanism, so it's said they adopt the best of both worlds.</td>

    <td width = '60%' align = 'left'>These are the switches that most modern mechanicals will have, the most commonly used. There are a large variety of switches, but in general, Cherrys are what you think of when you think of mechanical switches. They are solid, have a good feel, and have a variety of options. These options and differences will be highlighted below.</td>

    <td width = '60%' align = 'left'>Kailh switches, are knock offs of popular Cherry MXs. They come in a variety of types (colors) which resemble original Cherry types (Yellow being an exception) - Blue Kailh = Blue MX, Red Kailh = Red MX etc. Cost of keyboard using these switches is their biggest advantage - prices start from $40. Although rated higher than Cheery MX in MTBF at 60M the jury is still out whether we will see defects like Switch Chaaatttteeerrrriiinnnng.</td>

    <td width = '10%'>Razer Switch</td>
    <td width = '60%' align = 'left'>Well, it is said that they're MX but made just for gaming. Produced by a variety of Chinese companies, they come in two types - orange and green. Green is similar to MX Blues whereas orange is something near Browns. Are these switches made for gaming? Yes. Are they worth? Not really, as several reviews show the difference (0.2mm, within margin of error for Cherry MX) to be negligible, while some claim to notice less uniformity from switch to switch.</td>
